Initially, we had a little bit of trouble coming up with an idea the first week and a half after we got assigned to our groups.
We each had our own ideas, but none of us were really satisfied with them/aware of how to incorporate them into a full stack application.
This was solved when Nathan K. let us know about his work in Astronomy and came up with the idea to have
a space tourism website from which potential customers could view information about different astronomical destinations
and book a flight for said destinations.

Once we had separated duties between the team members, we eventually ran across an issue where we could not get customer
information to post to the database. It would create an object with the information, but would not add it to the Mongo
database. This was solved when we had the professor look over it with us.
